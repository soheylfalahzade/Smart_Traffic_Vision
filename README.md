# 🚦 Smart Traffic Vision System
**Real-time Vehicle Detection using YOLOv8 & Computer Vision**

This repository demonstrates a foundational implementation of **Object Detection** for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It leverages the state-of-the-art **YOLOv8** architecture to identify and classify road objects (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs) with high precision.

## 🖼️ Results (Before vs. After)
### AI Detection Output:
![Detected Traffic](output_detected_traffic.jpg)
*(The model successfully detects buses and pedestrians with high confidence scores)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Core AI:** YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV
- **Language:** Python 3.x

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- Integration with **ByteTrack** for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT).
- Deployment on **NVIDIA Jetson** for edge computing.
- Implementing Fuzzy Logic for traffic signal optimization.
